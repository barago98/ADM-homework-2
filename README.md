here's the main questions:
1) [RQ1] A marketing funnel describes your customer’s journey with your e-commerce. It may involve different stages, beginning when someone learns about your business, when he/she visits your website for the first time, to the purchasing stage, marketing funnels map routes to conversion and beyond. Suppose your funnel involves just three simple steps: 1) view, 2) cart, 3) purchase. Which is the rate of complete funnels?

2) [RQ2] What are the categories of the most trending products overall? For each month visualize this information through a plot showing the number of sold products per category.

3)[RQ3] For each category, what’s the brand whose prices are higher on average?

4)[RQ4] How much does each brand earn per month? Write a function that given the name of a brand in input returns, for each month, its profit. Is the average price of products of different brands significantly different?

5)[RQ5] In what part of the day is your store most visited? Knowing which days of the week or even which hours of the day shoppers are likely to visit your online store and make a purchase may help you improve your strategies. Create a plot that for each day of the week show the hourly average of visitors your store has.

6)[RQ6] The conversion rate of a product is given by the number of times a product has been bought over the number of times it has been visited. What's the conversion rate of your online store?

7)[RQ7] The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. Also known as 80/20 rule, in e-commerce simply means that most of your business, around 80%, likely comes from about 20% of your customers.
Prove that the pareto principle applies to your store.
